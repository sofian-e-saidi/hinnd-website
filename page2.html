            <h1 class="title">A letter for you</h1>
            <br>
            <p>It all started on December 19th at 2:19 AM just a random reel I shared with you, not knowing it would lead to something more. Since then, our conversations have grown, from school and life to random late-night thoughts. I never had to change the way I talk, the way I write, or anything about myself to connect with you it just happened naturally</p>
          
            <p>For a long time, I kept chasing people who didn’t really care. But when I stopped looking elsewhere and focused on what was already there, I realized that the connection I was searching for had been right next to me all along</p>
           
            <p>Hind, I think I have feeling for you. I love your voice, your face, the way you add extra letters to every word. I love the way you send selfies that only show your long hair, the random "I’m hungry" messages, the way you respond to compliments, and even the moments when you feel down. I love how you hate studying so much that I have to keep pushing you to do it. I love your obsession with Hello Kitty and Chinese dramas, your love for food in other words, I love you and everything about you</p>
           
            <p>I know life hasn’t been easy for you, and I know the struggles you face. Lately, that has become my motivation—to work harder, to push myself further, to build a future where I can make things easier for you. Maybe that’s years away, but it’s my goal</p>
            
            <p>But as much as I understand my own feelings, I also understand that love isn’t something we can force. So, I will respect your choice, whatever it may be</p>
            
            <p>Do you feel the same way?</p>
